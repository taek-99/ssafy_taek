### 1. When did you go to a park most recently? Which park did you go to and who did you go with? Tell me all about that last visit to a park in as much detail as you can.

저번달에 일본에 혼자 여행에 갔을때 공원에 방문하였습니다. 여행 도중 시간이 비어서 휴식을 취하기 위해 방문하였습니다. 벤치에 앉아 음료수를 마셨습니다. 즐겁게 노는 아이들과 조징을 하며 운동을 하는 사람들이 많았습니다. 좋은 날씨와 평화로운 분위기에 힐링이 되었습니다.

Last month, I went to a park when I was traveling alone in Japan.
During my trip, I had some free time, so I decided to visit the park to relax.
I sat on a bench and drank a beverage while taking a short break.
There were many children playing happily, and I also saw people jogging and exercising.
The weather was really nice, and the atmosphere was very peaceful, so it was very healing and relaxing for me.

### 2. Please tell about your favorite park. What is it like? Where is it located? What makes that park different from other parks?

석촌호수에 있는 공원이 가장 좋았습니다. 왜냐하면 큰 호수를 중심으로 여러 나무와 산책 코스가 잘 만들어져 있습니다. 멀리서 롯데월드도 구경할 수 있습니다. 벤치가 잘 이루어져 있어 많은 사람들이 식사를 하였습니다. 특히 벚꽃이 피었을때 공원이 이뻐서 사진을 찍기 좋았습니다.

My favorite park is the park around Seokchon Lake.
It is built around a large lake, and there are many trees and well-organized walking paths, which makes it a great place to take a walk.
From the park, you can also see Lotte World in the distance, so the view is very unique.
There are many benches, so a lot of people sit there to rest or enjoy their meals.
What makes this park special is that it becomes very beautiful during cherry blossom season.
When the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, the park looks amazing, and it’s a perfect place to take photos.

### 3. Tell me what people usually do at the park you go to.

제가 자주 가는 공원엔 주로 조깅하거나 산책하는 사람들이 많습니다. 강아지와 산책하는 사람도 많이 보입니다. 저녁엔 분수쇼가 있어 많은 사람들이 모여서 구경합니다.

At the park I usually go to,
many people go jogging or take a walk, especially in the morning and evening.
I also see a lot of people walking their dogs,
so the atmosphere feels very relaxed and friendly.

In the evening, there is a fountain show at the park,
and many people gather to watch it.
Families, couples, and friends often stand around the fountain
and enjoy the view together.
Overall, the park is a lively place where people relax and enjoy their free time.
