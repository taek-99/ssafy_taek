### 1. You indicated in the survey that you like to listen to music. What kind of music do you like and when do you usually listen to it? Where do you get your music?

나는 주로 J팝 음악을 좋아합니다. 주로 유튜브뮤직앱을 사용하여 듣습니다. 교통수단을 이용할때 음악을 듣습니다. 음악을 들으면 지루하지 않고 이동할때 즐거워집니다. 최근에 스피커를 구매하여 집에서 음악을 들을때 더 좋은 음질로 음악을 들을 수 있습니다.

I usually enjoy listening to J-pop.
I mainly use YouTube Music to listen to it because it’s convenient and has a wide variety of songs.

I usually listen to music when I’m using public transportation, like buses or subways.
Listening to music helps me feel less bored, and it makes my commute much more enjoyable.

Recently, I bought a speaker, so now I often listen to music at home as well.
Thanks to the better sound quality, I can enjoy my favorite songs even more, and it helps me relax after a long day.

### 2. Can you tell me about a memorable live music experience you had? When and where was it? Who were you with? Why was it memorable?

저는 아직 라이브 콘서트에 가본 경험은 없습니다. 왜냐하면 라이브 콘서트 티켓을 구하는데에 실패했기 떄문입니다. 제가 제일 좋아하는 그룹은 오피셜히게단디즘입니다. 일본가수이기 때문에 다음에 한국에 방문하게 된다면 반드시 라이브공연에 가보고 싶습니다. 그중에 가장 좋아하는 노래는 "Pretender"라는 노래입니다. 이 노래는 신나고 가사의 내용이 좋아서 들으면 행복해집니다.

Actually, I haven’t had a chance to go to a live concert yet.
The main reason is that I failed to get tickets, so I felt a bit upset.

My favorite band is Official Hige Dandism.
Since they are a Japanese band, it’s not easy for me to see them perform live in Korea.
However, if they ever visit Korea in the future, I definitely want to attend their concert.

Among their songs, my favorite one is "Pretender."
I really like it because it has an upbeat melody and meaningful lyrics.
Whenever I listen to it, it puts me in a good mood and makes me feel happy.

Even though I haven’t experienced a live concert yet, I believe it would be very memorable
because it’s my favorite artist and something I’ve been looking forward to for a long time.
