나는 주로 J팝 음악을 좋아합니다. 주로 유튜브뮤직앱을 사용하여 듣습니다. 교통수단을 이용할때 음악을 듣습니다. 음악을 들으면 지루하지 않고 이동할때 즐거워집니다. 최근에 스피커를 구매하여 집에서 음악을 들을때 더 좋은 음질로 음악을 들을 수 있습니다.

I usually enjoy listening to J-pop.
I mainly use YouTube Music to listen to it because it’s convenient and has a wide variety of songs.

I usually listen to music when I’m using public transportation, like buses or subways.
Listening to music helps me feel less bored, and it makes my commute much more enjoyable.

Recently, I bought a speaker, so now I often listen to music at home as well.
Thanks to the better sound quality, I can enjoy my favorite songs even more, and it helps me relax after a long day.
