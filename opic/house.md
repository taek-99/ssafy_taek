### 1. I would like to know where you live. Can you describe your home to me? what does it look like? How many rooms does it have?
나는 빌라에 혼자 살고있습니다. 2개의 방과 하나의 화장실이 있습니다. 발코니가 없어서 거실에 빨래를 널어놓습니다. 큰방에서 주로 자거나 공부를 하고, 작은방은 옷방으로 사용하고 있습니다. 창문이 크지 않아 환기가 잘 되지 않습니다. 벽지는 밝고 따듯한 색입니다. 집의 크기는 커서 만족스럽지만 엘레베이터가 없어서 힘든 점이 있습니다. 주변엔 상가가 많아 밤에는 다소 시끄럽습니다. 주변에 하천이 있어 러닝하기가 좋아서 춥지 않은 날엔 자주 러닝을 합니다. 

```  
I live alone in a villa-style apartment.
It has two rooms and one bathroom. But, there’s no balcony, so I usually dry my laundry in the living room.

I mainly sleep and study in the larger room, and I use the smaller room as a walk-in closet. The windows aren’t very big, so ventilation isn’t great, but the wallpaper is bright and warm-colored, which makes the place feel cozy.

The size of the apartment is quite spacious, so I’m satisfied with that. However, there’s no elevator, so it can be tiring to go up and down the stairs. Also, there are many shops nearby, so it can get a bit noisy at night.

On the bright side, there’s a stream near my place, which is perfect for running. When the weather isn’t too cold, I often go jogging there.

```
ventilation - 벤틸레이션 - 환기
spacious - 스페이셔스 - 널찍한
satisfied - 세터스파이드 - 만족한

### 2. Tell me about the house or apartment you lived in when you were a child. How was it different from the one you live in now? What are yhe similarities and differences?
어릴땐 가족들과 함께 아파트에 살았습니다. 지금은 빌라에 혼자 살고 있습니다. 예전 집엔 발코니도 있고 신형이라 좋았습니다. 지금 집은 구형에 발코니가 없어서 빨래를 거실에 널어야 하는 불편한 점이 있습니다. 예전엔 가족이 다함께 살아서 좋았습니다. 지금은 혼자 지내고 있어서 때때로 외롭다는 느낌이 듭니다. 두 집 모두 벽지가 밝고 따뜻한 느낌이 듭니다. 어릴적 가족들과 다같이 즐거운 시간을 보냈던 기억이 좋아서, 요즘은 가끔 어릴때가 그립습니다.

When I was a child, I lived in an apartment with my family.
Now, I live alone in a villa-style apartment, so my living situation is quite different.

My old apartment was newer and had a balcony, which was very convenient. In contrast, my current place is older and doesn’t have a balcony, so I have to dry my laundry in the living room, which can be a bit inconvenient.

Another big difference is the atmosphere. In the past, I lived with my whole family, so the house always felt lively and warm. These days, I live by myself, and I sometimes feel a little lonely.

However, there are also some similarities. Both places have bright, warm-colored wallpaper, which gives a cozy feeling. I still remember spending happy times with my family in my childhood home, and because of those memories, I sometimes miss those days..

In contrast - 인 칸트레스트 - 그와 반대로
atmosphere - 엣머스피어 - 분위기
similarities - 시멀레러티즈 - 공통점


### 3. Think back to the day when you moved into the place you live in. When did you move? Did you have anybody who helped you? Tell me everything that happened on that moving day

6개월 전에 이사했습니다. 서울에 자취를 하기 위해 아빠가 이사를 도와줬습니다. 짐이 많지 않아 이사 업체를 이용하지 않았습니다. 이사하는 집이 4층인데 엘레베이터가 없어서 다소 힘들었습니다. 새로운 집에 들어가면서 앞으로 열심히 공부해서 빨리 성공해야겠다고 다짐했습니다. 짐을 빠르게 정리 후 근처 중국집에 가서 축하파티를 하였습니다. 

```
I moved into my current place about six months ago.
I moved to Seoul to live on my own, and my father helped me with the move.
Since I didn’t have many belongings, I didn’t use a moving company.

The apartment is on the fourth floor, and there is no elevator,
so carrying the boxes upstairs was pretty exhausting.

When I first entered the new place,
I promised myself that I would study hard and become successful as soon as possible.
After we finished unpacking quickly,
we went to a nearby Chinese restaurant and had a small celebration together.

```

### 4. Now, tell me about the things that you do at home. What are some parts of your daily routine? What is special about each activity?

저는 집에서 보내는 시간이 많지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 집에서 일찍 출발해서 늦게 들어오기 때문입니다. 먼저 6시에 일어나서 샤워하고 영양제를 챙겨먹은 후 6시 20분에 집에서 나갑니다. 22시에 집에 돌아와 씻고 과제나 공부를 한 뒤 1시쯤 잠을 잡니다. 주말엔 평소보다 잠을 오래자서 피로를 해결하고, 밀린 집안청소를 진행합니다. 식사는 보통 배달음식으로 해결합니다.

```
I don’t spend a lot of time at home during the week
because I leave early in the morning and come back late at night.

I usually wake up at 6 a.m.
After taking a shower, I take some supplements,
and then I leave home around 6:20.

I usually get back home at around 10 p.m.
After washing up, I work on my assignments or study for a while,
and I usually go to bed around 1 a.m.

On weekends, I sleep longer to recover from fatigue,
and I clean my house since I don’t have time during the week.
As for meals, I usually order delivery food because it’s convenient.

```

### 5. Tell me about a change you made to your home. What was the change and why did you make that change? How did your home look afterwards? Give me all the details

금방 이사갈 예정이라 큰 변화를 주진 않았지만, 집에 불편한 부분들이 있어 몇가지 설치를 하였습니다. 화장실이 너무 습해서 제습제를 설치하여 쾌적하게 만들었습니다. 제 방에 옷장이 없어 행거를 설치하여 옷을 보관하고 있습니다. 발코니가 없어서 거실에 건조대를 두고 옷을 말리고 있습니다.

```
I’m planning to move out soon,
so I didn’t make any major changes to my home.
However, there were a few inconvenient parts,
so I made some small improvements.

First, the bathroom was very humid,
so I placed a dehumidifier to make it more comfortable.

Also, there is no closet in my room,
so I installed a clothes rack to store my clothes.

Since there is no balcony,
I also put a drying rack in the living room to dry my laundry.
After these changes, my home became much more practical and comfortable.
