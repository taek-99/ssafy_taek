### 1. Please describe your neighborhood in detail. What kinds of shops, parks, of facilities are nearby?

저는 빌라에 살고 있습니다. 근처에 편의점과 시장이 있어 필요한 물품을 사기 편리합니다. 도보권에 역이 있어 이동할때 편리합니다. 병원과 약국은 걸어서 10분거리에 있습니다. 하천이 잘 꾸며져 있어 러닝하기 좋아 따뜻한 날에 대체로 러닝을 합니다. 상가가 많아 밤에는 다소 시끄럽습니다. 주변 이웃들은 친절해서 좋습니다.

I live in a villa, and my neighborhood is very convenient.
There are convenience stores and a traditional market nearby,
so it’s easy to buy daily necessities.

There is also a subway station within walking distance,
which makes commuting very convenient.
Hospitals and pharmacies are about a ten-minute walk away.

There is a well-maintained river nearby,
so it’s a great place to go running.
On warm days, I usually go for a run there.

There are many shops and restaurants around the area,
so it can be a bit noisy at night.
However, the neighbors are friendly,
which makes the neighborhood pleasant to live in.

### 2. Let's talk about where you live. Tell me what you like and don't like about your neighborhood

가장 큰 장점은 편의시설이 잘 되어있습니다. 역이 가까워서 교통이 편리합니다. 편의점과 시장이 가까워 필요한 물건을 바로 살수 있습니다. 이웃들이 친절해서 좋습니다. 하지만 단점으론 상가가 많아 밤에 다소 시끄럽습니다. 그리고 주차공간이 부족해서 불편합니다. 그래도 전반적으로 만족합니다.

The biggest advantage of my neighborhood is that it has great facilities.
The subway station is very close, so transportation is convenient.
There are convenience stores and a traditional market nearby,
which makes it easy to buy what I need right away.
I also like the fact that the neighbors are friendly.

On the downside, there are many commercial areas,
so it can be a bit noisy at night.
Also, parking space is limited, which can be inconvenient.

Even so, overall, I’m satisfied with my neighborhood.

### 3. Tell me how you first met one of your neighbors. Describe in detail when you met and everything that happend during your first few meetings

이사도중 이웃 주민을 만났습니다. 저한테 밝게 인사해주셔서 저도 잘 부탁드립니다고 인사했습니다. 친절한 이웃을 만나 기분이 좋았습니다. 계단에서 종종 마주치곤 하는데 그때마다 밝게 인사해주셔서 기분이 좋아집니다. 집에 선반이 고장나 도움을 요청했는데 흔쾌히 도와주셔서 감사했습니다.

```
I first met one of my neighbors while I was moving into my place.
I was carrying some boxes when the neighbor greeted me with a bright smile.
I greeted them back and said something like, “Nice to meet you. I hope we get along well.”

I felt really good because they seemed very friendly.
Since then, we often run into each other in the stairwell,
and every time we meet, they greet me warmly, which always makes me feel pleasant.

One day, a shelf in my home was broken,
so I asked for help, and the neighbor kindly helped me without hesitation.
I was very grateful, and that experience made me feel lucky to have such a nice neighbor.

```

### 4. Tell me what you do with your neighbors. How often do you see them? What do you like to do with them and what do you usually talk about with them?

종종 계단에서 만나면 반갑게 인사합니다. 하지만 이웃들과 다른 외부 활동을 한경험이 없습니다. 왜냐하면 제가 아침 일찍 나가서 밤 늦게 들어오기 때문입니다. 기회가 된다면 이웃분들과 커피한잔 하거나 운동도 하는듯 좋은 교류가 있으면 좋겠습니다.

```
I usually greet my neighbors when I run into them in the stairwell.
We don’t spend much time together doing activities outside.

The main reason is that I leave home early in the morning
and come back quite late at night,
so our schedules don’t really match.

Even so, whenever we see each other,
we greet each other warmly,
and that simple interaction makes me feel good.

If I get the chance in the future,
I would like to have a cup of coffee or work out together with my neighbors.
I think that kind of casual interaction would be nice.

```

### 5. What kind of community do you live in? Are the people mostly students? Newly-weds? Parents with children? Or retired people? Tell me also how you interact with your neighbors

동네는 전반적으로 어르신들이 많은 동네입니다. 그래서 집 주변은 전반적으로 조용한 분위기입니다. 걸어서 10분거리엔 상가들이 많아서 젊은 사람들이 많이 놀러옵니다. 그래서 그쪽은 시끄러운 분위기입니다. 이웃과의 교류가 많은 편은 아니지만 종종 마주치면 반갑게 인사하며 좋은 기분을 나눕니다.

```
The community I live in is mostly made up of older people.
Because of that, the area around my home is generally quiet and calm.

However, about a ten-minute walk away,
there are many shops and commercial areas,
so a lot of younger people come to hang out there.
That area tends to be much noisier.

I wouldn’t say that I interact with my neighbors very often,
but when we run into each other,
we greet each other warmly and share a positive moment.
That kind of simple interaction makes living here pleasant.
